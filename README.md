# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm a 22-year-old maker, and I love building things.

I'm currently cofounding [Gypsy](https://www.gypsy.city/), where I serve as CTO. Where we are tokenizing real estate to build a new way of life where remote workers can travel the world while gaining home ownership. I am currently the sole developer and work on:

- Frontend (React)
- Backend (Node.js)
- Smart contracts (Solidity)
- Tokenomics
- Devops (Azure)
- Security
