# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently cofounding [Gypsy](https://www.gypsy.city/), where I serve as CTO. At Gypsy, we are tokenizing real estate to create a new way of life where remote workers can travel the world while gaining home ownership. 

I am currently the sole developer and work on:

- Frontend (React)
- Backend (Node.js)
- Smart contracts (Solidity)
- Tokenomics
- Devops (Azure)
- Security
